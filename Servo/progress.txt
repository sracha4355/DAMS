12/23:
I tried making the servo rotate 180 degrees but it leads to unpredictable
results. The however rotating it 90 degrees is predictable, and I am able to tochoose the angle with accurate results.
Next step: is figuring out how mant steps to increment the angle by to capture as much information as possible.
